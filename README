This repository is for a project I undertook (from 01/08/18 to 15/08/18)
for the South Riverside Community Develpment centre (SRCDC) in Cardiff. 
They wanted data on poverty and deprivation in the areas of Canton, Grangetown,
and Riverside. They will then use this data when applying for funding, and to 
inform how they use their resources. 

In this repository is my report, as well as any code or data that I found 
useful.
